RECENT CHANGES

0.022
-----
• New status and defaultStatus window properties
• New  screen  method that returns a screen object.  This object  cur-
  rently does  nothing,  but  serves  mainly  as  a  placeholder  for
  future use.

0.021
-----
The ‘open’ method now respects <base href> elements.

0.020
-----
• There are no longer circular references preventing the window, docu-
  ment and response objects from being freed.
• WWW::Mechanize  is now an optional prerequisite,  allowing smoother
  installation.
