WWW::Scripter, version 0.009 (alpha)

For scripting web sites that have scripts

This is a subclass of WWW::Mechanize that uses the W3C DOM and pro-
vides scripting support.


CHANGES IN THIS RELEASE

See the Changes file for the long version.

• count_timers and  check_timers  now know about timers in  (i)frames.
• The base URL for an  about:blank  page in a frame is now taken from
  the parent window.
• Adding an inline script to the DOM dynamically  (e.g.,  via  append-
  Child) no longer produces a warning.
• Empty script elements with no src attribute no longer cause  errors.
• check_timers now catches script errors and turns them into warnings. 
• Location objects are no longer shared between frames.
• Event handlers with  call_with  methods  no  longer  get  passed  a
  strange internal-only object.
