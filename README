For scripting web sites that have scripts

vides scripting support.


RECENT CHANGES

0.020
-----
• There are no longer circular references preventing the window, docu-
  ment and response objects from being freed.
• WWW::Mechanize  is now an optional prerequisite,  allowing smoother
  installation.

0.019
-----
Fix a dependency problem

0.018
-----
Loading a page that had a  <meta>  tag with no  http-equiv  attribute
(e.g. , <meta charset=utf-7>)  would cause uninitialized warnings  in
perl 5.12.0 and higher if a script  handler  was  present.  This  has
been fixed.


INSTALLATION

The easiest way to install this module is to use the CPAN module or
the cpan script:

    [sudo] perl -MCPAN -e "install WWW::Scripter"

    [sudo] cpan WWW::Scripter

Or you can use the following:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    [sudo] make install


PREREQUISITES

This module requires  perl  5.8.3 or higher (5.8.4  or  higher  recom-
mended)  and the following modules,  which can be found on the  CPAN:

  HTML::DOM 0.045 or higher
  LWP 5.77 or higher
  URI
  WWW::Mechanize 1.2 or higher

After installing, you can find documentation for these modules with
the perldoc command.

Or try using man (it's faster, in my experience):

    man WWW::Scripter
