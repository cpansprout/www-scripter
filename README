WWW::Scripter, version 0.023 (alpha)

For scripting web sites that have scripts

This is a subclass of WWW::Mechanize that uses the W3C DOM and pro-
vides scripting support.


RECENT CHANGES

See the Changes file for the long version.

0.023
-----
• WWW::Mechanize::Link objects returned by  WWW::Scripter  can now be
  dumped via  Data::Dumper,  instead of  producing  a  ‘Can't  locate
  object method FETCHSIZE’ error.
• /../ at the beginning of a URL path is now stripped out.
• The warning displayed when a script cannot be loaded now  uses  the
  URL and line number of the page containing the <script> tag.

0.022
-----
• New status and defaultStatus window properties
• New  screen  method that returns a screen object.  This object  cur-
  rently does  nothing,  but  serves  mainly  as  a  placeholder  for
  future use.

0.021
-----
The ‘open’ method now respects <base href> elements.
