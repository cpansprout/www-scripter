WWW::Scripter, version 0.008 (alpha)

For scripting web sites that have scripts

This is a subclass of WWW::Mechanize that uses the W3C DOM and pro-
vides scripting support.


CHANGES IN THIS RELEASE

• The base method now uses HTML::DOM’s base method,  in order to work
  with multiple <base> tags and dynamic changes to the base.
• We now include scroll,  scrollBy and  scrollTo  methods,  in case a
  script  tries  to  call  them.  They  don’t  actually  do  anything.
• Frames with no src element or an empty src element used to load the
  parent page,  resulting in infinite recursion.  This has been fixed.
• setTimeout  now works  with  a  code  ref  as  the  first  argument.
• count_timers no longer clobbers the $_ variable.
