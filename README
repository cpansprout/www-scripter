WWW::Scripter, version 0.016 (alpha)

For scripting web sites that have scripts

This is a subclass of WWW::Mechanize that uses the W3C DOM and pro-
vides scripting support.


CHANGES IN THIS RELEASE

• If a script handler’s event2sub method leaves something in  $@,  it
  is now picked up and handed off to the ->warn method.
• check_timers  used to ignore some code ref timers if the JavaScript
  plugin was not loaded.  It is only supposed to  ignore  strings  of
  code. This has been fixed.


INSTALLATION

The easiest way to install this module is to use the CPAN module or
the cpan script:

    [sudo] perl -MCPAN -e "install WWW::Scripter"

    [sudo] cpan WWW::Scripter

Or you can use the following:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    [sudo] make install

mended)  and the following modules,  which can be found on the  CPAN:
