  tect a tied  $_  from modification by other  modules  WWW::Scripter
  depends on.

The easiest way to install this module is to use the CPAN module or
the cpan script:

    [sudo] perl -MCPAN -e "install WWW::Scripter"

    [sudo] cpan WWW::Scripter

Or you can use the following:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    [sudo] make install

mended)  and the following modules,  which can be found on the  CPAN:
