WWW::Scripter, version 0.010 (alpha)

For scripting web sites that have scripts

This is a subclass of WWW::Mechanize that uses the W3C DOM and pro-
vides scripting support.


CHANGES IN THIS RELEASE

• New dom_enabled  method that allows HTML parsing to be switched off.
• Scripts served with a content  type  of  text/html  are  no  longer
  parsed into inaccessible DOM trees.  This used to cause warning mes-
  sages if a JS file when read as HTML appeared  to  contain  scripts.
• The  document  method now returns  undef  if the page is  not  HTML,
  instead of returning the previous page’s document.
