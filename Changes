Revision history for WWW::Scripter

0.006  30 September, 2009
       WWW::Scripter now overrides  WWW::Mechanize’s submit method to
       trigger  onsubmit.  (Thanks to  Steven  Nikkel  for  stumbling
       across this.)

     • max_docs and max_history have been added. Mech’s stack_depth
       is  now  honoured.  (max_docs  is  an  off-by-one  alias  to
       stack_depth.)
     • When no  browsing  has  happened,  the  current  page  is  now
       about:blank.  (It used to be an uninitialised state  in  which
       some methods, such as uri, would just die.)
     • URL fragments are now supported.  They are now  stripped  from
       URLs when the actual request is made (they used to be sent  to
       the server).  Fetching a URL that differs from the current one
       only by its fragment does not reload the page,  but does add a
       history entry.  You can now use the location object to get the
       URL with its fragment.  Use the uri method to get the real URL.
     • location->replace now works correctly.  (It used to be a quick-
       and-dirty ‘back’ followed by ‘get’.)
     • location->reload  now actually reloads the  page.  In  version
       0.002,  it would simply refresh the  page  from  the  response
       object.  Version  0.003  broke  that  by  making  it  a  no-op.
     • Support for onunload handlers
     • onload handlers are now called on the window, not the body ele-
       ment, with the document as the event target.
     • WWW::Scripter  no longer inherits from  HTML::DOM::EventTarget,
       but  it  still  provides  the  interface,  so  it  now  has  a
       DOES method.
     • Setting the value of the location  object’s  hash  and  search
       attributes now works.  It used to be a no-op unless it was set
       to the old value.
     • The host, hostname, pathname, port, protocol, search and  href
       methods of the  location  object  now  return  the  old  value
       upon setting.
     • The host and hostname methods of the location object have been
       corrected  such  that  host  now  returns  the  port  as  well,
       hostname  no longer returns the port,  setting  hostname  to a
       string containing a port no longer sets the port  and  setting
       host with a port number now works.  (In other words, they were
       switched round and were a bit buggy, too.)
     • I forgot to add the  CSS  interface  to  the  class_info.  Now
       it’s there.

       The  frames  method no longer dies when the page is  not  HTML.

     • When you go back  (or forward)  to a page,  the same  document
       object is  used  once  more.  It  used  to  be  parsed  afresh.
     • Detecting the charset now works with LWP 5.827 and later.

       One bug fix: The credentials method now works.

0.001  5 April, 2009
       First release. This consists of code copied and pasted from
       parts of WWW::Mechanize::Plugin::DOM and the experimental
       plugin version of WWW::Mechanize at
       <http://www-mechanize.googlecode.com/svn/wm/branches/plugins/>,
       plus some new code to tape it all together.
