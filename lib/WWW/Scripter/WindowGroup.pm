=head1 NAME

WWW::Scripter::WindowGroup - Multiple-window browsing environment

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.014

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use WWW'Scripter'WindowGroup;
 
 $browser = new WWW'Scripter'WindowGroup;
 # This has one window already
 
 # OR:
 
 $browser = new WWW'Scripter'WindowGroup empty => 1;
 $browser->attach($w = new WWW'Scripter);
 
 $w = $browser->active_window;
 $w->get('http://ghare.dr/');
 $w->close;
 
 $w = $browser->new_window;
 @w = $browser->windows;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a virtual multiple-window browsing environment for
L<WWW::Scripter>. It does not actually create any windows on the screen, 
but
it can be used to script websites that make use of multiple windows. The
individual windows themselves are WWW::Scripter objects.

Before you start using this, consider whether the site you are scripting
actually I<needs> multiple windows. If a single-window environment will do,
use L<WWW::Scripter> directly.

Note: Window groups hold strong references to their windows, but the 
windows themselves hold weak references to the window group. So if you let
a window group go out of scope while retaining a reference to a window,
that window will revert to single-window mode.

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item new

The constructor. Call this method on the class, not on an object thereof.
It takes no arguments.

=item active_window

Returns the window that is currently 'active'. This can be changed by
scripts calling the C<focus> method on a window, or opening a new one, so
keep your own
reference to it if you need to refer to a specific window repeatedly.

=item windows

Returns a list of all windows in list context, or the number of windows in
scalar context.

=item new_window

Adds a new WWW::Scripter to the window group and returns it.

=item attach ($window)

This methods adds a window to the group, making it the frontmost window and
setting its C<window_group>
attribute appropriately.

If you attach a window that is already attached to another group, strange
things may happen. Detach it first.

=item detach ($window)

This removes the window from the group and sets its C<window_group>
attribute to C<undef>. This is used internally by
WWW::Scripter's C<close> method.

=item bring_to_front ($window)

This makes C<$window> the active window.
