=head1 METHODS

=over

=item length

Returns the number of items in the browser's history.

This is 1 when you
haven't gone anywhere yet.

=item index

Returns the current position in the history list.

=item go ( $distance )

Moves forward (positive C<$distance>) or back (negative) in history, or
reloads the page if C<$distance> is 0. If the C<$distance> would cause
navigation beyond either beginning or end of the history list, nothing 
happens.

=item back

Same as C<< $history->go(-1) >>.

=item forward

Same as C<< $history->go(1) >>.

=item pushState( $some_scalar, $title, $url )

This adds a 'dummy' entry to browser history, which is identical to the
current page (actually, it I<is> the current page), except that it has the
state information contained in C<$some_scalar> associated with it. The
C<$url>, if specified, becomes the URL of the current page (so a script can
lie about what the URL is). The C<$title> is ignored.
